Carver's Scalloped Potatoes

8 tablespoons butter (1 stick)

1½ pounds onions, halved and sliced ¼-inch thick

1 teaspoon thyme

4½ pounds potatoes, baked, chilled and sliced to ¼-inch (skins on)

1½ cups bechamel sauce

2 cups heavy cream

1 cup sour cream

12 ounces Parmesan/Monterey jack cheese mix, divided use

1 tablespoon mixed kosher salt and coarse ground black pepper

Cooking spray

Instructions:

Melt the butter in a sauté pan. Add onions and cook over medium heat until translucent. Add thyme and mix thoroughly. Sauté one more minute. Combine the potatoes with the onion mixture; toss to coat.

In a separate bowl, combine and thoroughly mix bechamel, cream, sour cream, 6 ounces of cheese mix and the salt and pepper mix. Add potato mixture and mix thoroughly. Spray a 2-inch-deep baking pan with cooking spray. Evenly spread potato mixture in pan, pressing down firmly to eliminate air pockets. Cover with foil. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove foil. Spread remaining cheese mix evenly over potatoes. Bake until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.
